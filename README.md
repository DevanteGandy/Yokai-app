CHECK OUT YOKAI - https://yokai-app.netlify.app/


a simple content discovery for horror and supernatural anime.


//
I built this with an intent that
User should be able to click on different animes
Users should be able to view different anime
Users should be able to see when the anime was created, what its about, when it was created.

I started with building the image row for horror first and then implementing a modal for a single image which i went back to our lessons for, using that i wanted to make it so on each image would pop up its specfic image and content. i struggled with trying to get my images to pop up inside the modal at first but i was able to get with some friends and figure it out together.


after getting the modal to work, now on each image click it should pop up the modal box with a bigger sized image, the title, the synopsis and the date it was created.

I did struggle with CSS a bit, but just figuring out how everything works and what i can actually do with CSS is incredible.
